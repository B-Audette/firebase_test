# Work in Progress Alert

## Firebase Demo Test

Used this [setup](https://blog.logrocket.com/user-authentication-firebase-react-apps/) from the [LogRocket Blog](https://logrocket.com/) as guidelines to build a firebase athentication demo with [Contexxt API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html).

I chose to use `react-router-dom` in place of `@reach/router`
